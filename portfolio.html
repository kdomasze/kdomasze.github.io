					<p>
                        This project's goal was to design and implement a complete chess program with an AI opponent in 5 weeks. My role in the project was to design and implement a UI for the game. My primary goal was to create a user interface that required as little modification of the main game in order to function properly.

						<h4>Design Process</h4>
					</header>
					<p>
                        Initially, I opted to create a text interface to quickly produce a workable output for my fellow team members to utilize while working on their own parts of the project. Once I had completed this task, I moved on to creating a graphical user interface. I opted to utilize the SDL 1.2 as per the suggestion of our professor. After spending some time reading the documentation and experimenting with SDL, I proceeded to implement the new GUI.

                    <p>
                        To ensure the error checking and movement systems my teammates implemented were utilized, early on I designed the code to grab input information from the user and pass it to the core program.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After deciding on a design for the UI, I began by implementing the GUI by drawing the chess board itself and aligning the chess pieces. Next, I spent some time working with the event system in SDL to capture mouse clicks from the user. Once I could capture the mouse clicks, I moved onto adding the logic for highlighting the places on the chess board the player selects (along with checks for illegal clicks on the board).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once these core features were completed, I replaced the text-based UI with the graphical one for testing. Once I confirmed it was working as intended, I moved onto creating the menus throughout the program for game setup.
